Here is the challenge, Next.js and Tailwind CSS were used in its construction.

To run the project, start the backend server and use the commands npm i and npm run dev.

Make sure the backend is running at the address http://localhost:3004. If it's running on a different port, inside the folder src->pages->index.tsx, there's a variable called API_URL. Just update the API address there.
